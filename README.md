==========

Small scraper of dba.dk written for my wife.

The project is to play around with a couple of technical ideas that I haven't had the chance to use yet. 

## Constraints

- backend storage is only allowed to append data, no in-place updates or deletes
- each api must do one thing only (provide search, scrape, app, user-data) (microservices)
- deployment must be done using docker
- one page app

## Notes to self
